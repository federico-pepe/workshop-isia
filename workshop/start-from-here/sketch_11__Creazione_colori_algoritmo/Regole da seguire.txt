These are the simple rules to follow:

1. Work in HSB (hue, saturation and brightness) color space and not in RGB (red, green and blue).
2. The secret is to consider the hue value around a circle so the hue is the angle of the wheel. The values are between 0 and 360. First of all, we have to pick a number randomly.
3. Let’s pick saturation and brightness values randomly as well (usually between 0 and 100).
4. Now we have our first color which is positioned at the centre of our palette.
5. Choose another random number. This techniques works best if we pick between 0 and 180. Then we have to add and subtract this value to the original hue.
6. Now we have the second and fourth color.
7. Add and subtract again the last number we chose to the second and fourth color.
8. To have perfect results, set saturation and brightness randomly for every color.
